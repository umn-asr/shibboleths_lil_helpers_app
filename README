=====
This intent of this app is to bring Shibboleth's Lil Helper to the web.

    https://github.com/uofm/shibboleths_lil_helper

Though I'd like to make an app that helps non-ruby folks set up a
Shibboleth SP, I don't have the time to make this happen right now.
They'll have to bite the bullet and just learn the little ruby required
to use Shibboleth's Lil Helper ;).

If you are a Rails developer and want to make this happen--get ahold of
me (https://github.com/joegoggins), it would be cool to see a web-ified
shibboleth's lil helper.
